## 🔄 What About Firebase?

You can still use Firebase for:
- ✅ **Database** (Firestore) - Keep using it
- ✅ **Authentication** - Keep using it  
- ✅ **Storage** - Keep using it

Just deploy your **Next.js app** to Vercel while keeping your **data** in Firebase. This is a very common and effective pattern.
